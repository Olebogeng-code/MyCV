            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <h3>Who I am</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Olebogeng Aron Segoe, I am originally from Rustenburg, Phokeng. My family clan is the
                Bakgomong. "Kgomo e ntsho ntsho e esenang mebala."
                That means a pitch-black  cattle that does not have or tinted by any other color but black
                throught.
                <br>

                By profession I am a GCC certified Mechanical Engineer currently working as a Maintenance Superintendent
                at the Glencore FerroChrome Smelter Plant.
            </p>

            <h3>Experience</h3>

            <p>
                I have 8 years of experience working for Glencore in maintenance of Plant machinery. I have also worked
                for Eskom Research, Testing and Development team for a period of almost two years.
            </p>

            <h3>My Passion</h3>

            <p>
                I have a passion in a couple of things that I love doing during my spare time.

                High End Real Estate Videography. I love creating real estate reviews of high end luxury homes. This
                endevour pushed me to develop even more skills that I never thought I'd enjoy doing. I have developed
                presentation skills, video editing skills and videography as an art.

                Musician, Bassist at church. Music is a place where I find my moment of happiness when I am feeling low.
                Low frequency notes is what I am most passionate about. Music is not music without a low end note. I
                play as a bassist at my church every Sunday.
                My favorite music genre is gospel music. The lyrics behind the musical instruments is what makes me feel
                connected closer to God.
            </p>
            <h3>My Motivitation</h3>

            <p>
                In 2017 I met a beautiful rose that my heart could not resist but fell inlove with. This rose I call,
                The Rose Of Sharon. It's the most beautiful rose in the whole world. This rose is currently my
                wife. She is my motivation in life.

            </p>
            <h3>What I would most like to do?</h3>

            <p>
                Spending quality time with my family.
            </p>
